# How to use
⚠️ The Wiki is slowly moving to https://github.com/CodyNinja1/TMIBruteforceGUI/wiki ⚠️

There's a [TMIBruteforceGUI Discord server!](https://discord.gg/Pr4beaVxhf), if you don't have a GitHub account this is where you can ask questions, give suggestions etc 

First, install Python, either from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/python-311/9NRWMJP3717K) or from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3111/).

After Python is done installing or you already have Python, go to [the latest release](https://github.com/CodyNinja1/TMIBruteforceGUI/releases/latest) and download the the ZIP file

Once the ZIP is downloaded, extract it.

Make sure to install the Visual C++ Build Tools: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/

After you've done those, open your Command Prompt/Terminal in the extracted folder and type run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

After those are done installing you can open TMInterface.

In that same Command Prompt/Terminal Process, type `python bf_gui.py` and hit enter. 

If there's a warning saying there's a new update, it's recommended to press Yes, it will automatically update all needed files, then re-open bf_gui.py.

Now you should have a GUI on your screen! Select your bruteforce goal of choice, change the settings and validate a replay. Happy bruteforcing! :partying_face:

Huge thanks to Shweetz, Sai-Moen, and Stuntlover for actively working on this project!
