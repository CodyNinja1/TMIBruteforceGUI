# How to use
⚠️ The Wiki is slowly moving to https://github.com/CodyNinja1/TMIBruteforceGUI/wiki ⚠️

There's a [TMIBruteforceGUI Discord server!](https://discord.gg/Pr4beaVxhf), if you don't have a GitHub account this is where you can ask questions, give suggestions etc 

First, install Python, either from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/python-311/9NRWMJP3717K) or from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3111/).

Now install the Visual C++ Build Tools: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/, after the launcher is done setting up, press `Desktop Development with C++` and then `Install` in the bottom right

After those are done installing or you already have Python and the C++ Build Tools, go to [the latest release](https://github.com/CodyNinja1/TMIBruteforceGUI/releases/latest) and download the the ZIP file

Once the ZIP is downloaded, extract it.

Open TMInterface and run the bf_gui.py file with Python, either by double clicking it or running `python bf_gui.py` in your terminal in that directory

If there's a warning saying there's a new update, it's recommended to press Yes, it will automatically update all needed files, then re-open bf_gui.py.

Now you should have a GUI on your screen! Select your bruteforce goal of choice, change the settings and validate a replay. Happy bruteforcing! :partying_face:

We are actively trying to improve the tool in any way we can, whether it's adding new scripts, fixing bugs, etc.
