# TMIBruteforceGUI
This script provides an easy way to use bruteforce scripts in TMInterface using a GUI! No more changing variables in the source code!

# How to use
Install Python, either from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/python-311/9NRWMJP3717K) or from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3111/)

After Python is done installing or you already have Python, press the big green `Code` button on this page -> Click `Download ZIP`, extract the ZIP into a folder

After you've done that, open your cmd/terminal in the extracted folder and type `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` if pip doesn't work in your cmd/terminal, after those are done installing you can open TMInterface.

Open the `bf_gui.py` file (with python), now you should have a GUI on your screen! Select your bruteforce goal of choice, change the settings and validate a replay. Happy bruteforcing! :partying_face:
