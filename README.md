# TMIBruteforceGUI
This script provides an easy way to use bruteforce scripts in TMInterface! No more changing variables in the source code!

# How to use
Install Python, either from the Microsoft Store: https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/python-310/9PJPW5LDXLZ5 or from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/

After that's done, type `pip install tminterface`, `pip install imgui` and `pip install numpy` in your cmd/terminal, after those are done installing:

Open TMInterface

Press the big green `Code` button -> Click `Download ZIP`, extract the ZIP file and open the `bf_gui.py` file, in the python console it should say `Registered to TMInterface0`, and in the TMInterface console `Registered a new client`

Now you should have a GUI on your screen, select your bruteforce goal of choice, change the settings and validate a replay. Happy bruteforcing! :partying_face:

(We are actively trying to improve the tool in any way we can, if it's adding a new script, fixing bugs etc, if you have any suggestions feel free to make a pull request or open an issue)
