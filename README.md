# TMIBruteforceGUI
This script provides an easy way to use bruteforce scripts in TMInterface! No more changing variables in the source code!

![Bruteforce Script Window on Startup](/script.png?raw=true)

# How to use
Install Python, either from the Microsoft Store: https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/python-310/9PJPW5LDXLZ5 or from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)

After Python is done installing, press the big green `Code` button on this page -> Click `Download ZIP`, extract the ZIP into a folder

After you've done that, open your cmd/terminal in the extracted folder and type `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your cmd/terminal, after those are done installing you can open TMInterface.

Open the `bf_gui.py` file (with python), now you should have a GUI on your screen! Select your bruteforce goal of choice, change the settings and validate a replay. Happy bruteforcing! :partying_face:

Huge thanks to Shweetz, Sai-Moen, and Stuntlover for actively working on this project!
